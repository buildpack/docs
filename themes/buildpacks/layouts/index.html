  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <section class="row">
    <div class="col-sm">
      <p><strong>Buildpacks</strong> were first conceived by Heroku in 2011. Since then, they have been adopted by Cloud Foundry and other PaaS such as Gitlab, Knative, Deis, Dokku, Drie and Google App Engine.</p>

      <p>The <b>Cloud Native Buildpacks</b> project was initiated by Pivotal and Heroku in January 2018 and joined the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Sandbox</a> in October 2018. The project aims to unify the buildpack ecosystems with a <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/buildpack.md" target="blank">platform-to-buildpack contract</a> that is well-defined and that incorporates learnings from maintaining production-grade buildpacks for years at both Pivotal and Heroku.</p>

      <p>Cloud Native Buildpacks embrace modern container standards, such as the OCI image format. They take advantage of the latest capabilities of these standards, such as cross-repository blob mounting and image layer "rebasing" on Docker API v2 registries.</p>

  "body": "# pack v0.2.1\r\n> This is a patch to the second **beta** release of the Cloud Native Buildpack local CLI. This platform implementation should be relatively stable and reliable, but breaking changes in the underlying [specification](https://github.com/buildpack/spec) may be implemented without notice. Note that pack is intended for local image builds, and thus requires a Docker daemon. The [lifecycle](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle) should be used directly when building on cloud platforms.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites \r\n\r\n- The [Docker daemon](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed on your workstation or accessible over the network.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nIf you're on macOS, you can use Homebrew:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew tap buildpack/tap\r\n$ brew install pack\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise:\r\n\r\n1. Download the `.tgz` or `.zip` file for your platform\r\n2. Extract the `pack` binary\r\n3. (Optional) Add the directory containing `pack` to `PATH`, or copy `pack` to a directory like `/usr/local/bin`\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\nRun the command `pack`.\r\n\r\nYou should see the following output\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage:\r\n  pack [command]\r\n\r\nAvailable Commands:\r\n  build                 Generate app image from source code\r\n  run                   Build and run app image (recommended for development only)\r\n  rebase                Rebase app image with latest run image\r\n  create-builder        Create builder image\r\n  set-run-image-mirrors Set mirrors to other repositories for a given run image\r\n  inspect-builder       Show information about a builder\r\n  set-default-builder   Set default builder used by other commands\r\n  suggest-builders      Display list of recommended builders\r\n  version               Show current 'pack' version\r\n  help                  Help about any command\r\n\r\nFlags:\r\n  -h, --help         Help for 'pack'\r\n      --no-color     Disable color output\r\n  -q, --quiet        Show less output\r\n      --timestamps   Enable timestamps in output\r\n\r\nUse \"pack [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n- Fix critical bug that results in a failure to restore layer metadata to the correct location (https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle/pull/137).\r\n- Move detection results to the beginning of each line (https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle/pull/134).\r\n\r\n**NOTE: All changes in this patch are from the corresponding [lifecycle release](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.2.1).**\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n- Publishing to a private registry from Windows still fails in some cases (#109). We have fixed this upstream in Docker for Windows (https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/pull/139), but Docker will need to ship a new version to fix this bug."

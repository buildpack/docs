The `pack rebase` command allows app developers to rapidly update an app image when its stack's run image has changed.
By using image layer rebasing, this command avoids the need to fully rebuild the app.

```bash
$ pack rebase <image-name>
```

### Example: Rebasing an app image

Consider an app image `my-app:my-tag` that was originally built using the default builder. That builder's stack has a
run image called `pack/run`. Running the following will update the base of `my-app:my-tag` with the latest version of
`pack/run`.

```bash
$ pack rebase my-app:my-tag
```

Like [`build`](/docs/using-pack/building-app), `rebase` has a `--publish` flag that can be
used to publish the updated app image to a registry.

### Rebasing explained

![rebase diagram](/docs/using-pack/rebase.svg)

At its core, image rebasing is a simple process. By inspecting an app image, `rebase` can determine whether or not a
newer version of the app's base image exists (either locally or in a registry). If so, `rebase` updates the app image's
layer metadata to reference the newer base image version.

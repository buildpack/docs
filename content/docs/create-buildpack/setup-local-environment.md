First, we'll create a sample Ruby app that you can use when developing your buildpack:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/ruby-sample-app
cd ~/workspace/ruby-sample-app
```

Create a file in the current directory called `app.rb` with the following contents:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

set :bind, '0.0.0.0'
set :port, 8080

get '/' do
  'Hello World!'
end
```

Then, create a file called `Gemfile` with the following contents:
```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

git_source(:github) {|repo_name| "https://github.com/#{repo_name}" }

gem "sinatra"
```

Now, let's create the directory where your buildpack will live:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/ruby-cnb
cd ~/workspace/ruby-cnb
```

Finally, make sure your local Docker daemon is running by executing:

```bash
docker version
```

If you see output similar to the following, you're good to go! Otherwise, start Docker and check again.
